Gen* = General Stff (Blocks without main function)
UNUSED_* = Stuff that god discarted. NOT recomended to use them.

add more later on.

TODO:

- Do the P1 sprites (P2 will just use a recolor of said P1 sprites)
- Import finished textures (ground tiles, Mushroom platform, etc)
- Code special blocks (Bricks, item boxes, etc)
- Make LDTk usable to make levels.

Optional:

- Internet connectivity (Time trials, )
- Bonus levels
- Level/World selector
- Overworld map (Kind of like SMB3?)
- Options menu
    - If this turns out correctly, we can also maybe add an "Endable Semisolids Collisions" option?
    - Also a key remapper, but I don't think this will fly.
- Uploading the OST in YT would be quite nice tho.
- Level Intros (Ah... This w[on't]ill be fun.)
